Implementation Summary
I've created a comprehensive implementation of the Container Security vulnerability management use case, following the architecture patterns discussed. Here's a summary of what we've built:
Domain Models and Events

ContainerVulnerabilityEvent: The domain event representing a discovered container vulnerability
Vulnerability: Core model representing vulnerability details
Container: Model representing containers with vulnerabilities

Data Sources

StackRoxClient: Service for communicating with the StackRox API
KubernetesMetadataService: Service for retrieving cluster metadata from Azure
StackRoxVulnerabilityDetector: Event source that scans for vulnerabilities
CveAllowlistProvider: Dimension source for CVE allowlist data
ClusterProvider: Dimension source for cluster information

Processors

VulnerabilityProcessor: Processes detected vulnerability events
ContainerVulnerabilityRepository: Repository for vulnerability state management

Interactors

VulnerabilityNotifier: Sends notifications about vulnerabilities via various channels

Startup and Configuration

Startup: Configures services and dependencies for the Container Security domain

Key Features

Tenant Isolation: Events, notifications, and state are properly tenant-aware
Regional Awareness: Event sources respect regional boundaries
Dimension Integration: Reference data used for filtering and enrichment
State Management: Proper persistence of vulnerability state
Multi-Channel Notifications: Teams, Slack, and Email notification support

This implementation showcases the key architectural patterns of the Trickle platform:

Vertical Slicing: The Container Security domain is self-contained with clear boundaries
Shared Foundations: Common abstractions are leveraged across components
Connector-Processor-Interactor Pattern: Clear separation of concerns
Dimension Framework: Efficient reference data management
Event-Driven Architecture: Events flow through the system with proper enrichment

The code is structured to support both C# and PowerShell implementations, with a focus on providing fluent, easy-to-use APIs for developers of varying skill levels. The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and retry policies for resilience.
