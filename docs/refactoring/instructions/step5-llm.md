Initial Instructions:
- Implement a complete vertical slice for Container Security
- Include vulnerability management, process alerts, and network alerts
- Show the full flow from collector to analyzer to responder
- Integrate all previously built components
- Provide clear extension points for future security domains

Important Context:
- This implementation will serve as the reference for other security domains
- StackRox API integration is critical for this domain
- We need to maintain proper separation between collection, analysis, and response
- Security teams will use this as a template for their own domains
- The implementation should demonstrate best practices for the entire platform
