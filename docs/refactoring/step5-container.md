# Step 5: Container Security Implementation

## Branch: `refactor/step5-container-security`

## Goals
- Implement complete Container Security vertical slice
- Integrate all previously built components
- Demonstrate end-to-end flows for key scenarios
- Provide clear extension points for other security domains

## Key Scenarios

### 1. Vulnerability Management
- Detect vulnerabilities from StackRox
- Track vulnerability state over time
- Generate notifications for critical issues
- Provide remediation guidance

### 2. Process Alerts
- Monitor container process anomalies
- Detect suspicious processes
- Correlate with known patterns
- Trigger appropriate responses

### 3. Network Alerts
- Monitor container network activity
- Detect unusual connection patterns
- Identify potential data exfiltration
- Generate alerts for security teams

## Implementation Components

### StackRox Integration Service
```csharp
namespace Trickle.ContainerSecurity.Core.Services.StackRox
{
    public interface IStackRoxClient
    {
        Task<List<Vulnerability>> GetVulnerabilitiesAsync(string clusterId = null);
        Task<List<ProcessAlert>> GetProcessAlertsAsync(string clusterId = null);
        Task<List<NetworkAlert>> GetNetworkAlertsAsync(string clusterId = null);
        Task<List<Cluster>> GetClustersAsync();
    }
}
```

### Collectors

VulnerabilityCollector - Collects vulnerability data from StackRox
ProcessAlertCollector - Collects process alerts from StackRox
NetworkAlertCollector - Collects network alerts from StackRox

### Analyzers

VulnerabilityAnalyzer - Analyzes and enriches vulnerability events
ProcessAlertAnalyzer - Analyzes process-related security events
NetworkAlertAnalyzer - Analyzes network-related security events

### Responders

VulnerabilityNotifier - Sends notifications for vulnerabilities
SecurityAlertResponder - Handles alerts from all types
RemediationOrchestrator - Initiates automated remediation

### Implementation Approach

Set up StackRox client
Implement collectors for each data type
Create analyzers with state management
Build responders with notification templates
Test end-to-end flows

Example Flow: Vulnerability Management

VulnerabilityCollector polls StackRox API
Collector publishes ContainerVulnerabilityEvent to Event Grid
VulnerabilityAnalyzer processes event and updates state
Analyzer determines severity and publishes VulnerabilityNotificationEvent
VulnerabilityNotifier sends notification via appropriate channel

### Extension Points

Additional vulnerability sources
Custom severity scoring
Alternative notification channels
Remediation automation
Cross-domain correlation
